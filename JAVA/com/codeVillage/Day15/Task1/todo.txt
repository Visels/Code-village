----> Create an accounts window between the login window and main menu.
----> Make the account type an enum.

Applying OOP Concepts build simple program to mimic your bank mobile experience
    Customer has below details
        - name
        - Address
        - Mobile Number
        - Id number
        - pin

                    - description
            - Account Balance

                    - code (KES,USD)

            - amount
            - debitAccount
            - creditAccount

    1. Customer should be able to
        - check balance
        - deposit
        - withdraw
        - send money
    - ask your customer to input pin
    - check if the pin is correct

    //display balance if 1 is selected
    //when they select2 allow them enter amount
    //then display the new balance
    //
    //enhancements

    - we don't the program to terminate until a user selects an option
    - conditional loops while loop, do while

    - Allow users to own and access multiple accounts
